DTSA 5798 Supervised Text Classification for Marketing Analytics Final Project

## Abstract
A report focused on modeling news article categorization for marketing analytics. This notebook focuses on the application of natural language processing, supervised learning with k-train (a wrapper for Tensorflow, Keras, and Huggingface Transformers), and a evaluation of performance.

## Results
The newly built model was able to meet and exceed expectations for the sensitivity (recall) of the model. It achieved a sensitivity 4% higher than the baseline (93% vs. 89%). Again, sensitivity is the true positive rate, or how often the prediction is correct, for actual positive values. By increasing this metric, the company can capture more websites aligned to their target customer base.

In addition, the metrics, including F1 Score, are all above 90% and exceeded the expected baseline metrics. This is a positive indicator that the model will satisfy the customers needs and drive improved customer success for their marketing campaign.
